# ChatMC
- *For now its only supports Windows.*

**Clone and run for a quick way to see ChatMC in action.**
```
git clone https://github.com/RKStudioTM/ChatMC
cd ChatMC
npm install
npm start
```

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic ChatMC application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to display. This is the app's **Graphical User Interface**.
- `render.js` - A script to read and render logfile to existance. This is the app's **renderer process**.
